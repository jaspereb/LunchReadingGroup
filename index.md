## The Lunch Reading Group

This page is to manage the ACFR lunch time reading group.

The idea of the lunch reading group is to have a presenter explain an interesting or informative recent paper/technique while everyone eats lunch. It is modelled on the image reading group but is an informal chance to spend lunchtime finding out about a topic outside of your research area.

Currently we are also going through a reinforcement learning tutorials set which will be every 2-3 weeks as an ongoing series of talks.

Meetings are held every **Tuesday from 1:15pm to 1:45**, presentations should last 20-40 minutes with time for discussion included.

## Guidelines
-Upload the paper or presentation at least 1 day prior  
-It's informal, so present however you feel is most useful. Presenting should not be a significant burden so don't spend too long preparing.  
-Pick whatever recent paper you have found most interesting or useful which other people are unlikely to have read  
-Lunch appropriate illustrations (looking at you Wei Rong)
