## The Lunch Reading Group

This page is to manage the ACFR lunch time reading group.

The idea of the lunch reading group is to have a presenter explain an interesting or informative recent paper/technique while everyone eats lunch. It is modelled on the image reading group but is an informal chance to spend lunchtime finding out about a topic outside of your research area.

Meetings are held every **Tuesday from 12:30pm to 2pm** though we usually finish earlier, presentations should last 30-60 minutes with time for discussion included.

Previously, we went through a reinforcement learning tutorials set. The content followed David Silver's lectures at http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html

A good blog post for an overview of actor critic methods (and the A2C algorithm) is

## Guidelines
-Upload the paper or presentation at least 1 day prior  
-It's informal, so present however you feel is most useful. Presenting should not be a significant burden, providing a clear overview of the work, along with contributions and limitations is more important than having nice slides  
-Pick any recent paper you have found interesting or useful which other people are unlikely to have read  
-Lunch appropriate illustrations please (looking at you Wei Rong)
